# Flashcard Project

MyReads allow users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks. 

## How it works

This project has these functionalities below:

* Allow users to create a deck which can hold an unlimited number of cards.
* Allow users to add a card to a specific deck.
* The front of the card should display the question.
* The back of the card should display the answer.
* Users should be able to quiz themselves on a specific deck and receive a score once they're done.
* Users should receive a notification to remind themselves to study if they haven't already for that day.

## Technologies I've used here

* Nodejs
* Reactjs
* create-react-native-app
* React Navigation
* Expo

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app/blob/master/README.md).
